# Insight Evaluation on Traditional and CNN Features

> Here are our detailed experiments and results we conduted and presented in our current paper with the same name as title. 

### 1. Dataset 
We use two main datasets, namely MNIST and CIFAR-10 with the partitions divided as below:

|              	|   MNIST Dataset   	| CIFAR-10 Dataset 	|
| Training set 	|       60000       	|       50000      	|
| Test set     	|       10000       	|       10000      	|

### 2. Structures

** Folder: Traditional Filters

** Folder: CNN Approach

In this folder, we conducted two practical experiments: 

* Experiment 1: Apply a basic CNN network (14 Conv2D Filters, MaxPooling, Flatten and two FC layers).
* Experiment 2: Apply a basic CNN network as above with additional layers (BatchNormalization and Dropout).
